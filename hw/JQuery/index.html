							<p>Energy balls are the perfect healthy treat for everyone! If you are a lazy cook, look no further! They do not require any sort of baking skills because they are raw. Plus, if you have any dietary restriction they will most likely suit you: they are vegan and gluter free, so will accomodate most you!

					    What is more, they take minutes to prepare, which makes them the perfect go-to snack. They are packed with healthy and energising ingredients, and can be boosted with plenty of superfoods.
					    They can go by a variety of different names: energy bites, protein balls, power balls, vegan truffles.. There are so many recipes on the web, this one is my favorite. </p>

						      <ul>
						      <li>Oats. This is one is my favorite cereal to use as a flour because it very clean, filling and easy to manage.</li>
						      <li>Nut butter. Nut butters, like peanut butter or almond butter, help stick all the ingredients together and adds that extra yum that we all deserve. </li>
						      <li>Coconout flakes. To make it look like they are little snowballs and give it a lil more sweetness.</li>
						      <li>Mix-ins! Here you can be as creative and fancy as you like- superfood additions, such as flaxseeds and chia seeds, can boost your immune system and other ingredients like chocolate (which I personally do not adore) can make it perfect to your taste.</li>
