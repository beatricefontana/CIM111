                <p>The site will focus on making people aware of how really things are and should be, because the first step to make a substantial change is understanding the issue addressed.
                I am upset that humanity has not yet realised that the fact that such tragedies still happen, is a clear signal that our way of approaching violence is deeply unsuitable. Organisations like Isis came about because of violence. Violence won't, therefore, defeat them. The only way to ensure a safe life to our future-selves and population, is non-violence.</p>
