  <p id="show1">Gun Violence is a real problem which threatens people all around the world, but especially in places where gun regulations and laws are too light or not as binding as they should — i.e. The United States.
The US is a specifically interesting but alarming case of gun related violence. It has, as a matter of fact a few problems it has to deal with to try and improve their situation.

Firstly, simply put americans own too many guns. America has 4.4 percent of the world’s population but almost half of the civilian-owned guns. This topic, i.e. the relationship and the correlation between the number of death by gun and the number of guns owned, has been broadly researched:




For example the Harvard Injury Control Research Center clearly states that: “gun availability is a risk factor for homicide, both in the United States and across high-income countries.”

    Potential Biological and Chemical Weapons of ISIS

    So, what do we know about ISIS’ chemical and biological weapons? Despite the frequent reporting by OPCW and UNSC from mid-2014 onwards, the public part of the story ends in November 2014 with quite a cliff-hanger, as you can see on the table.

    What has happed to the ricin program?
    There some more interesting issues that have been hinted to in the documents, which deserve some attention and which can be investigated further by the use of open source information. With astonishing openness OPCW speaks in the documents cited above of the “Al-Maliha ricin production facility” as the site where the program (at least in part) was located. Hence, the first and most driving question is: where exactly might this facility be located? Al-Maliha is an eastern suburb of Damascus. Given that the production facility is not underground (which is a possibility, though), there are basically three sites that can be considered. First, there is a military site.

Coordinates: 33°29’33.21’’N; 36°21’46.96’’E. Image taken on 8/15/2014.

Which, according to tags found in Wikimapia, is dedicated to the production of military garments. Everybody can write comments and notes in Wikimapia, and we have trouble believing that Syrian uniforms really have to be protected with the kind of security perimeters that can be observed on the satellite imagery. But whatever they really do in that complex, the configuration of the buildings has nothing in common with biotechnological sites and/or pharmaceutical facilities in Syria and elsewhere in the world. Based on this gut feeling, we would say: This is not the site. The second candidate, a rubber factory, seems to be exactly what it is said to be.

  <p id="show3">This page will discuss the global issues of domestic violence and forced marriage. It will entail some of the real life stories from across the world and some statistics. The aim of this page is to draw in more awareness to the horrors that happen behind closed doors. This issue in itself is difficult to control because so many people are afraid to speak, seek help or even fight back. They need a voice, men, women and children.

This first section of the page will explore women in such situations. According to the Office of National Statistics, 2015, a current or former partner kills 2 women every week in England and Wale; this is 1 woman being killed every 3 days (Refuge, 2016). Some of you may feel quite shocked by this but why? I am sure that you are all aware that domestic violence is an issue that does happen globally. But when it comes to seeing the numbers and that we are oblivious to when it happens, is what I think what shocks us and moves us the most.
