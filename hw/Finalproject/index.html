      <h1> WHAT IS VIOLENCE</h1>
      <p id="quote">“Violence takes place when someone uses their position of power to hurt someone else on purpose, not by accident”. United Nations Secretary- General’s Study (2006).</p>

      <section id="grid1">
        <p>Essentially, an act can be defined as violent when you are willingly causing mental or physical pain to someone. It can occur on a large and on a small scale, towards people or animals, who you can love or hate. The reasons are infinite. What is very important to consider, is that frequently in our society it is well subdued and, therefore, is not taken into account. This type of behaviour is the most perilous, because to fight something it is fundamental to recognize its nature.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, it has a very high escalation potential: as soon as the conflict has started, the morals become futile and it is unlikely to cease. We should then settle in our minds the appropriate ideals; we are going to discuss ours in this web-site.</p>
